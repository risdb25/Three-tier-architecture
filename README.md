# Three-tier-architecture

Prototype of a distributed system using the three-tier architecure. 

This means the system has been separated into a top/presentation layer; middle/business logic layer; and bottom/database layer.

This code demonstrates my skills in C#, object-oriented programming, and developing for distributed systems.

This system was developed as my submission for a module's coursework assignment during my undergraduate studies. The purpose of the assignment was to develop a distributed business management system for employees of an online retailing corporation. The system must utilise an appropriate architecture to develop an effective solution such as client/server, P2P, service-oriented, remote method invocation, or three-tiered. The system is expected to be expandable and adaptive to accommodate changing business requirements in the future.
