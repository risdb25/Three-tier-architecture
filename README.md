# Three-tier-architecture

This project demonstrates my skills in:
* C#
* object-oriented programming
* developing for distributed systems
* GUI applications
* linking a database (Microsoft SQL Server) to a desktop application

Prototype of a distributed system using the three-tier architecure. 

This means the system has been separated into a top/presentation layer; middle/business logic layer; and bottom/data layer.

This system was developed as my submission for a module's coursework assignment during my undergraduate studies. The purpose of the assignment was to develop a distributed business management system for employees of an online retailing corporation. The system must utilise an appropriate architecture to develop an effective solution such as client/server, P2P, service-oriented, remote method invocation, or three-tiered. The system is expected to be expandable and adaptive to accommodate changing business requirements in the future.
